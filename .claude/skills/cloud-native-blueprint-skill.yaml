version: 1.0

purpose: |
  Define reusable cloud-native execution blueprints for agent-driven applications.
  This skill determines how recommended actions should be executed in different
  cloud environments (local, Kubernetes, event-driven) without embedding
  infrastructure-specific logic.

input:
  - intent: classified user intent
  - recommended_tools: abstract tool recommendations
  - deployment_context:
      environment: local | kubernetes | event-driven
      reliability_level: low | medium | high
      scalability_requirement: single | horizontal | event-stream
      latency_sensitivity: low | medium | high

output:
  - cloud_blueprint:
      execution_model: synchronous | async | event-driven
      communication_pattern: direct-call | pub-sub | command-event
      scaling_hint: none | horizontal-pod-autoscale | consumer-groups
      resiliency_hint: retry | circuit-breaker | idempotent
      observability:
        logging: basic | structured
        tracing: enabled | disabled

rules:
  - Do not reference Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Terraform
  - Provide declarative hints, not implementation steps
  - Ensure blueprint is portable across cloud providers
  - Maintain compatibility with MCP, REST, and event brokers

reusability:
  - Works across cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - Applicable to microservices, serverless, and event-driven systems
