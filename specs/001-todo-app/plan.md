# Implementation Plan: Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-08 | **Spec**: [specs/001-todo-app/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a command-line todo application that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete. The application will store all tasks in-memory with no external storage dependencies, following the specification's 5 core features and maintaining clean console navigation with proper input validation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (as specified in constitution - no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory only using Python lists/dictionaries (as specified in constitution and spec)
**Testing**: Manual testing as specified in feature spec (no automated tests for Phase I)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application - follows constitution structure requirements
**Performance Goals**: Instantaneous response for all operations (no network/database delays), minimal memory usage
**Constraints**: No external storage, no files, no databases, no network dependencies (as per constitution and spec)
**Scale/Scope**: Single user console application, no concurrent users expected, local in-memory storage only

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Compliance Verification:

✓ **Spec-Driven Development**: Following the specification created via `/sp.specify` and `/sp.clarify` commands as required

✓ **Clean Code Guidelines**: Will implement modular architecture with separation of concerns in models, services, and main CLI components

✓ **In-Memory Data Only**: Plan specifies in-memory storage using Python lists/dictionaries with no external storage dependencies

✓ **Progressive Evolution**: Architecture will be designed with future phases in mind while meeting current in-memory console application requirements

✓ **Technology Stack Compliance**: Using Python 3.13+ with only standard library modules as required by constitution

✓ **Project Structure**: Following constitution structure with `/src/` containing `main.py`, `models.py`, `services.py`

✓ **Implementation Method**: Code will be generated by Claude Code as required, not manually written

✓ **Constitution Adherence**: All implementation will follow rules defined in constitution file

### Source Code (repository root)

src/
├── main.py              # CLI entry point
├── models.py            # Task data model
└── services.py          # All task CRUD operations

**Structure Decision**: Following constitution requirements for project structure with main.py as CLI entry point, models.py for data models, and services.py for business logic. No tests directory included for Phase I as manual testing is specified in the feature requirements.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations identified. All implementation approaches comply with the project constitution requirements.
